# Chat App

The app should have a section that shows the existing set of messages, and each message should have an associated sender (a username). There should be a way to send a new message, which can be done with a simple text input and submit button. When sending a message, it should show up with the rest of them in the proper order.

## Requirements

- Messages can be stored locally in the client. Assume that the inputs to the app are the existing set of messages and the current user's username.
- Assume that no other messages are coming in from other users or other clients.
- New messages created do not need to persist between sessions/page loads.
- Styling is optional.
- Start by opening [this StackBlitz project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-pquj91) and write your code there. "Save" your work and send back the link (the URL will change when you click "Save").
- The UI may look something like this initially:
- We can type messages in the input box
- After clicking Send:
